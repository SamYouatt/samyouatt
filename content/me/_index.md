I'm Sam, a Computer Science student currently evading hordes of geese to achieve my degree at the University of York. Upon completion of my final year I am wanting to enter the world of software development. Preferably not by force.

Always eager to learn I have dipped my toes in a wide range of computing areas and am looking forward to the opportunity to dive deeper into any that peak my interest as part of my vocation.
