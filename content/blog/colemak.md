## The Hardware

What good is a keyboard layout without a keyboard?

I first saw the Moonlander on [r/mechanicalkeyboards](www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards) and it wasn't necessarily the ergonomics that attracted me as much as it was the looks. But those looks don't come cheap and the price led to it falling out of my mind. But when November rolled around and I had to give Santa something to do, what better to ask from him than the board.

As mentioned I like a browse on r/mk, where I am bombarded by people's builds with a menagerie of switch flavours. The Moonlander features hot-swap switches so I wouldn't have to deal with two hours soldering like I did with my last keyboard, the temptation was too great and I ended up with a bag of 70 Gateron Ink Black's to prove it.

But the rabbit hole of keyboards doesn't stop there. Another common practice is modifying the switches themselves. Lubricant, films, spring swaps, stem swaps, there's almost no end to the lengths people will go to make their switches a fraction smoother with a little less rattle. Of course I am now people, with 70 lubed and filmed switches. An unusual but satisfyingly practical way to spend the Christmas afternoon.

## QWERTY Has Got to Go

When typewriters were invented we were constrained in the design of our typing instruments by mechanics. The levers responsible for imprinting the pages with our language had an annoying habit of being physical objects that collided with each other like toddlers in a whirlpool. To limit the rate of these collisions the decision was made to hinder everyone's ability to type quickly by making it as uncomfortable as possible.

The main goal was to try and encourage each consecutive letter pair to be as far away from each other as possible, allowing the two levers as wide a berth as possible, often times on opposite hands.

Fast forward to today and our keyboards have done away with levers and have evolved to make use of enslaved physical primitives, forced to move along wires to to our bidding and carry our messages. Yet due to the challenges of getting a whole population to change their opinion about anything, it is infeasible to move all keyboards away from qwerty's inherent efficiency and ergonomic disadvantages.

However for some people these downsides cannot be tolerated, and once again I have now found myself to be *people*.

### Dvorak, Coleman, Workman

No, I didn't cast a spell, I was listing some of the common alternatives to qwerty. I'm not going to go into a lot of depth on the different layouts and their individual motivations and quirks because there's a lot of information about them.

My personal decision to use Colemak was mainly driven by the fact it seems to be the most common among people switching to new layouts now, where Dvorak seemed to be at it's height longer ago. Although one key aspect of Colemak that stood out to me was it's drive to place common bigrams and trigrams (common two and three letter patterns like "st" and "ion") on different fingers to speed up the typing of them.

## Learning to Speak Again

An additional draw to Colemak is that it limits the amount of letters that change hand and fingers when compared to qwerty, which serves to make it easier to transition to the new layout.
