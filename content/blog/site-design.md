## Colours and Fonts

For the website I want to keep it simple. One because I think it will draw the attention to the main focus of the pages, the content, but also because I don't want to put a lot of effort into it right now.

### Stripey Background

The main visual styling will be a striped motif using the colours from the palette. This could be achieved by creating a background image in an image editing program and then setting that as the background image but I want a bit more control. It's also likely that I'll make tweaks and changes along the way so having something that I can control quickly if the colour palette changes or I decide on a different style will be helpful.

By adding in variables for the start gap and the width of the line, and doing some simple maths to define where colours should start and end, I can now easily control where I want the lines and how they should look. The embed below can be edited to see the effect changing these values has.
